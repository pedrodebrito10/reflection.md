Planning
The planning process for my shape sketch involved creating an initial drawing that outlined the core elements I wanted to include. 
I initially thought it would be straightforward, but translating my vision from paper to code required a more structured approach. 
Sketching out the basic forms helped me conceptualize the final product.

Implementation
Once I started coding, I realized how complex even simple shapes could be. F
inding the right coordinates and making sure the shapes aligned as intended was challenging. 
The logic behind positioning elements made more sense once I understood how coordinates interact with each other.

Testing and Troubleshooting
During the process, there were several times I had to troubleshoot why certain elements weren't displaying as expected. 
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the shapes maintained proportions across different screen sizes. 
Debugging those issues taught me a lot about precision and patience in coding.

Completion
By the end of the project, I felt proud of the final shape sketch. 
While it wasn’t perfect, it was a big step from my initial attempts. 
I also made some adjustments to the original drawing after realizing that some of the shapes needed more refinement. 
These edits were reflected in the final version.

Reflection
Looking back, I’m proud of how much I learned throughout the process. 
Initially, concepts like positioning and layering seemed confusing, but now I feel more confident. 
If I were to do this again, I would spend more time in the planning phase, making sure that the implementation phase goes more smoothly.
