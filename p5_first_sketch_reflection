Reflection on My First P5 Sketch
Initial Planning
When I first started planning my P5 sketch, I made a rough drawing of the basic shapes I wanted to create. 
Translating that into code seemed straightforward at first, but once I began coding, the process revealed complexities I hadn't anticipated. 
My original drawing helped guide me, but I had to adjust my expectations and make changes along the way.

Challenges
One of the most challenging aspects was understanding how the coordinate system works in P5. 
It took some time to get used to how positioning functions and how to adjust shapes based on the canvas size. 
Additionally, keeping track of the different shape properties, such as stroke weight and fill color, was tricky when I wanted multiple elements to work together seamlessly.

What I Learned
Through trial and error, I learned how to control shape sizes and positions more effectively. 
I also gained a better understanding of how code structure and logic play an important role in ensuring the sketch runs smoothly. 
The way functions like draw() and setup() work makes much more sense now than when I started.

Adjustments
During the implementation, I made several adjustments to my original design. 
Some shapes had to be resized or repositioned to fit the canvas better. 
I also added new elements as I became more comfortable experimenting with different shapes and colors.

Proud Moments
I’m proud of completing the sketch despite the initial challenges. 
Seeing the shapes come to life and interact with each other as intended was really rewarding. 
I’m particularly happy with how I was able to incorporate some of the additional drawings I made during the planning phase.

Final Thoughts
Looking back, I feel I’ve learned a lot about the process of planning, coding, and refining a sketch in P5. 
If I were to start over, I’d spend more time in the planning phase to better anticipate the coding challenges ahead.
Overall, I’m pleased with the outcome and look forward to building on this foundation in future sketches.
